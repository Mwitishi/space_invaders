This project is a Space Invaders game, coded in C using library SDL.

I am making it mainly for practicing SDL. It is not prepared for being
buildable in other computers. I will accept no responsibility.

However, the makefile includes a default target using GCC
(tested in Ubuntu 12.04) and a "win" target using MinGW under Ubuntu
for compiling Windows executables.
